Exploration and analysis of data on rainfall over various regions of India and especially the regions where agricultural works have been done persistently in a wide range. With the help of analysis and the resultant data, future rainfall prediction for those regions using various machine learning techniques such as XGBoost classifier, SVM classifiers, Decision tree, Naive bayes classifier, Logistic regression etc.
